This document's intended use is to explain how to add, commit, push and pull changes from Git.


1. Clone the repository into an empty directory, preferably on your desktop, using the command "git clone https://github.com/pbrunet44/Ya-Bee.git"
2. Before doing any work whatsoever, ensure you pull changes from Git, using the command "git pull"
3. Next, start working on your task/project, and once done, add those changes using the command "git add ." This will add modified files into the staging area.
4. Now commit those changes, with the command "git commit -m "<message>"". Here, <message> is just a message informing us of the changes you've made to the files.
5. Finally, you can push to the appropriate branch, using "git push <branch>". Please do not push anything to the master branch unless it's been previously discussed.

These will probably happen sometime in the future. I still haven't figured out a way we will deal with them, but I will fill this out when I do!
